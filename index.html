	        <h2>Background</h2>
	        <p>I'm a recent college graduate (BA in English) who is very interested in learning web development and programming. I don't have much experience with either so far, but I'm excited to learn how to build programs and websites. I enjoy learning on Treehouse and am excited about the new Techdegree program that is currently in beta but will be released soon.</p>
	        <p>I am a Christian and am deeply involved in my church, where I volunteer in children's ministry, attend multiple community groups, and volunteer with the cafe starting up next door.</p>
	        <p>Other things I enjoy doing including tennis, chess, billiards, and various board games.</p>
	      </div> 

	      <div class="card">
	        <h2>Goals</h2>
	        <p>I want to learn many different areas of web design and programming in my spare time, even if I end up specializing in only one or a few. Some of my areas of interest are:</p>
	        <ul class="skills">
	          <li>HTML</li>
	          <li>CSS</li>
	          <li>JavaScript</li>
	          <li>PHP</li>
	          <li>Ruby</li>
	          <li>Rails</li>
	          <li>Java</li>
	          <li>C</li>
	          <li>C++</li>
	          <li>Python</li>
	          <li>Objective-C</li>
	        </ul>
	        <p>I'd be happy to work in any programming or web design role. My strengths include probelm-solving, teamwork, and fast learning. Aesthetics and visual design, however, are not my strong suits, making me wonder whether working in web design is really for me.</p>

            </a>
	        <p>I enjoy making cakes for special occassions with my wife Celeste, and hope to grow a thriving family bakery business in addition to my porgramming and web development work and my wife's career in architecture.</p>

	        <h2>Long-Term Dreams</h2>
	        <p>A few of my long-term dreams include...</p>
	        <p>Getting a programming or web design job.</p>
	        <p>Having a large family and homeschooling my children alongside my wife.</p>
	        <p>Saving and investing enough money to retire at a relatively early age.</p>
	        <p>Going to seminary and getting an MDiv, eventually followed by a PhD in New Testament.</p>
	        <p>Creating a usable, accessible concordance to the Septuagint (the Greek Old Testament).</p>
	        <p>Eventually devoting myself to full-time ministry, perhaps as a pastor.</p>
